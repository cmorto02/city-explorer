# City Explorer

**Author**: Christopher Morton
**Version**: 1.2.0 

## Overview
This applications provides requested location data, to include : a map, meetups, and weather at the current iteration

## Getting Started
You must set up the front end, and back in to be able to take in and use data from multiple APIs. At the current time we are not required to cache data, so we have no need of an SQL server.

## Architecture
We are using the darksky API
google maps API
Meetups API
Superagent
CORS
Express

## Change Log
1.0.0 : The google maps API is sending back location data
1.1.0 : Using the location data from the google maps API we are pulling in location weather data
1.2.0  : Using the google maps API data we are pulling in information about meetups in the location searched.
